# Mission 7 follow-up: contact-safe control and privileged Approach

This follow-up continues the completed diagnosis in
[`MISSION7_APPROACH_DEBUG.md`](MISSION7_APPROACH_DEBUG.md). The six PPO studies,
benchmark geometry, and sensor comparison remain closed.

## Current status

The detailed contact probe ran on the same Haswell node (`cn-c22`) used for
the exact replay. Its first completed instrumentation pass was rejected:
extra per-contact force calls changed some replay trajectories. The probe was
then changed to reuse the existing single `mj_contactForce` call and to require
an explicit pose-match check before interpretation. The corrected filtered
probe then matched all ten retained episodes with maximum pose error `0.0`.

The first balanced privileged controller matrix reached 55/64. A replacement
using the measured 0.50 m/s translation command and the bounded 0.30 m/s stall
pulse reached 56/64 in the completed Approach portion, with 8/16 in world −x
and 16/16 in each other direction. Those failures are repeated goal-post
contacts before entering the goal region. The matched standstill control was
0/64. The run is retained as below-gate evidence; no sensor learning was
started.

The corrected contact probe, friction intervention, Approach matrix, and both
16-episode route batches are complete. The earlier results below are
diagnostic evidence; the final exact replay and route closeout are recorded in
the September 22 section that follows.

## Final staged replay and route closeout — September 22

The unchanged replay diagnosis identified the common causal state: the robot's
ankle entered a low plate while the base was laterally offset, with simultaneous
lateral translation and yaw correction. A staged maneuver was then tested on
the exact ten retained failures: approach to a pre-plate pose, settle for
0.40 s, and cross for 1.20 s with yaw correction frozen. Geometry, activation
schedule, fall predicate, and replay layouts were unchanged.

The first staged replay reached 9/10 upright, with layout 13 still falling
because it contacted the wrong-side plate before the correct-side-only staging
could activate. A nearest-plate extension also reached 9/10 but introduced an
earlier wrong-side intervention on layout 4. The guarded version retained
correct-side staging and allowed wrong-side staging only when the correct plate
was more than 1.0 m away. It reached **10/10 upright** on Slurm `21397732`;
the exact replay gate is therefore **passed**. The compact verdict is
[`plate-stage-cn-c22-guarded/result.json`](../results/mission7-approach-followup-20260922/plate-stage-cn-c22-guarded/result.json).

The existing one-layout legacy/measured route smoke completed on `21398074`
after an infrastructure-only snapshot correction. The documented 16-layout
route evaluation then completed on `21398514`: Doors **1/16** (4 falls,
11 timeouts) and Transport **0/16** (6 falls, 10 timeouts). These route results
use the existing `PlateSafeRouteController`; its separate replay component was
9/10 upright, so the guarded staged replay maneuver was not silently
substituted for that route controller. The route evaluation is therefore
unlocked and reported, but full-route reliability remains below a release-
quality level. Compact route evidence is
[`route-eval-cn-c22-v2/result.json`](../results/mission7-approach-followup-20260922/route-eval-cn-c22-v2/result.json),
with detailed episode traces retained outside git.

## Route generalization and episode-level failure analysis — September 22

The primary route evidence is the one-layout smoke `21398074` and the
16+16 evaluation `21398514`. The latter used the existing
`PlateSafeRouteController`, while the exact 10/10 gate used `PlateStage`; the
route traces contain **0/32 guarded-stage activations**. Thus the route result
was not itself a guarded-maneuver test. The read-only episode report is
[`route-failure-analysis/result.json`](../results/mission7-approach-followup-20260922/route-failure-analysis/result.json).

The operational taxonomy below identifies the first failed phase for every
route episode. `P` means the robot never reached a usable plate/door
interaction state; `A` means it reached the interaction boundary but failed to
complete alignment/plate traversal; `M` means transport acquisition/manipulation
failed before a completed plate interaction; `R` means it failed after an
interaction or route recovery; `S` is the one successful Doors episode.

| Episodes | First meaningful divergence | Terminal pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Doors `0,2,3,6,10,11,14,15` | P: route navigation stalled before the first plate | 8 timeouts |
| Doors `5,8(−x),12` | A: plate interaction/alignment did not complete | 3 timeouts |
| Doors `1,4,9,13` | R: post-plate/recovery progression failed | 4 falls |
| Doors `7` | S: both doors opened and were crossed | 1 success |
| Transport `3,10,11,14` | P: route navigation stalled before the first plate | 4 timeouts |
| Transport `2,6,7,15` | M: acquisition/manipulation state was not completed | 4 timeouts |
| Transport `8(−x),12` | A: plate interaction/alignment did not complete | 2 timeouts |
| Transport `0,1,4,5,9,13` | R: post-plate/recovery progression failed | 6 falls |

The aggregate is Doors 1/16 and Transport 0/16; the route controller recorded
no guarded-stage activation. The route trace had no first wall/door/goal-post
contact before the recorded falls. Plate contact is available as the route
controller's contact flag, so `plate_brake` is an approximate interaction
boundary, not a causal contact timestamp. World −x appears once in each route
stage (Doors/8 and Transport/8), so it is not disproportionately represented
in this 32-episode route sample, although layout 8 is a high-heading-error
outlier. The independent privileged Approach result remains 8/16 in world −x.

The ten successful guarded replay entries quantify only the observed entry
distribution, not a certified capture basin. They comprise 3 `+x` and 7 `+y`
entries, with no world −x entry:

| Entry feature | Successful replay range |
|---|---:|
| plate-center distance | 0.736–0.782 m |
| lateral offset | −0.782–+0.743 m |
| forward/longitudinal offset | −0.692–+0.130 m |
| heading error | −0.035–1.623 rad |
| world base speed | 0.105–0.805 m/s |
| yaw rate | −0.443–+0.421 rad/s |

The early layout-1 probe then tested route delivery into the unchanged stage.
The switch-handoff probe was completed as `21399211` (after infrastructure-only
failures `21399179` and `21399201`), and the early-handoff probe was completed
as `21399449`. The six-episode probe found 4/6 activations, 2/6 completions,
and 1/6 full success. The early two-episode probe found:

| Episode | Stage entry | Stage outcome | Route outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| Doors/1 | `+x`, distance 0.736 m, lateral −0.733 m, forward +0.069 m, heading +0.024 rad, speed 0.586 m/s | completed at 25.000 s; first target contact at 21.537 s | first door opened/crossed, then timeout at waypoint 8 |
| Transport/1 door 0 | `+x`, distance 0.741 m, lateral −0.739 m, forward +0.045 m, heading +0.039 rad, speed 0.963 m/s | completed at 25.800 s; target contact at 22.3195 s | route continued |
| Transport/1 door 1 | `−y`, distance 0.765 m, lateral −0.765 m, forward +0.015 m, heading +1.512 rad, speed 0.258 m/s | completed at 62.200 s; target contact at 59.035 s | full success at 84.120 s |

Both first-stage handoffs occurred before contact and all three staged
crossings completed. The entry distances, offsets, and heading errors are in
the successful replay ranges; Transport/1's first-stage speed is above the
replay maximum yet still completed. This does not support insufficient
PlateStage capture as the primary layout-1 cause, and the probe does not
provide a failed guarded-stage entry from which to estimate the basin edge.

## Post-stage route rejoin diagnosis — September 22

The read-only diagnostic `21399494` compared the successful Transport/1
control with failing Doors/1. Both exited `PlateStage` into a valid route
state: waypoint 4, `advance`, door 0 still closed, target `door_center`, no
reset/reinitialization hook, and no invalid/fall flag. Doors/1 exited at
25.000 s with base `[1.113, 3.936]`, yaw `0.113` rad, velocity
`[-0.238, 0.150]` m/s; Transport/1 exited at 25.800 s with base
`[1.234, 3.956]`, yaw `−0.028` rad, velocity `[-0.019, −0.091]` m/s and
`carrying=true`. Both route state machines opened door 0 and advanced through
waypoints 5–7.

The first meaningful divergence was physical at waypoint 8, not a stale
state transition. Doors/1 entered waypoint 8 at about 44.6 s near
`[4.317, 5.983]`, target `[6.0, 6.0]`, distance 1.683 m. The route emitted
the normal approximately 0.30 m/s forward command, but realized speed fell to
near zero and the base stayed around `[4.34, 5.98]`; waypoint 8, door/open
flags, and `advance` remained unchanged until the 180 s timeout. There was no
unintended contact and no fall onset. Transport/1 reached the same waypoint
near `[4.329, 5.998]`, with the same approximately 0.30 m/s command, then
advanced to waypoint 9 at 51.2 s and reached its second staged interaction.
The carried-object state is a route-level difference, so it is a plausible
physical/dynamic covariate, not evidence of a manipulation failure by itself.

The smallest justified correction was one bounded 0.30 m/s body-forward pulse
after 0.8 s without target-distance progress, preserving PlateStage internals,
early activation, physics, fall criteria, and task criteria. `21399502`
completed the diagnostic path but exposed a probe-argument wiring omission, so
the pulse did not run and that job is not treated as an intervention result.
The corrected exact Doors/1 rerun `21399503` did activate the pulse at
45.800–46.200 s. It still timed out at waypoint 8 with door 1 unopened and no
fall. Therefore the single restart pulse did not restore route progress; it
rules out a simple one-shot pulse as sufficient, but not all physical gait or
state-distribution explanations. Compact evidence is
[`route-rejoin-diagnosis-summary.json`](../results/mission7-approach-followup-20260922/route-rejoin-diagnosis-summary.json).

The evidence supports this causal chain:

`late route→PlateStage handoff` → fixed for the tested layout-1 episodes by
early polling; `PlateStage` → completed; `PlateStage→route rejoin` → valid
state transition but physical waypoint-8 stall in Doors/1. Thus route-to-stage
handoff is dominant for the original layout-1 pre-contact falls, but it is not
the dominant explanation for the remaining full-route failures and is not the
remaining Doors/1 failure. No separate manipulation failure is supported by
the paired Transport/1 success.

The next smallest experiment is a rejoin-only, deterministic Doors/1 state
isolation with the already completed Transport/1 trace as control: hold the
same waypoint-8 route target and log physical contacts, commanded body motion,
realized base velocity, and progress under one route-controller condition at a
time. The current pulse result does not justify another route sweep, a
threshold sweep, a sensor experiment, or a second simultaneous intervention.

## Contact dynamics hypothesis

The valid ten-episode trace shows that every retained failure contacted one or
more raised plates before falling. The first touches have negative contact
distance (penetration), tilted normals during edge contact, and large impulses.
The filtered probe reused the existing force call and reproduced every original
trajectory exactly (`maximum_pose_difference = 0.0` for all 10 episodes):

| Quantity | Observed range |
|---|---:|
| penetration | 0.00003–0.036 m |
| normal force | 0–2,015 N |
| tangential force | 0–420 N |
| friction coefficients | `(1.0, 0.005, 0.0001)` |
| solver reference | `(0.02, 1.0)` |
| solver impedance | `(0.9, 0.95, 0.001, 0.5, 2.0)` |

Every retained episode contacted one or more plates before its recorded fall;
the valid unchanged replay reproduced all 10/10 falls. Plate geometry stays
enabled and unchanged. The evidence supports plate penetration/impulse as a
common interaction state, while not by itself proving that force alone causes
the later fall. A replay with plate sliding friction changed from `1.0` to
`0.20` also produced 10/10 falls, so that parameter-only intervention is
rejected.

## Exact replay clearance diagnosis — September 22

The unchanged command stream was instrumented before another intervention. The
valid run is Slurm `21396492` on `cn-c22`, using the validated Mission7 Python
environment. The two earlier launches are infrastructure records: `21396422`
failed because the node default Python had no MuJoCo, and `21396448` was
canceled after its cross-node replay failed the required pose-match check. Only
`21396492` is interpreted scientifically.

All ten retained falls reproduced exactly (`maximum_pose_difference = 0.0` for
every episode), and all ten still fell. Every episode had a plate contact before
the fall; no first undesired wall, door, or goal-post contact preceded a fall.
The minimum robot/obstacle clearance ranged from −39.4 mm to −12.6 mm, and the
minimum plate-edge clearance reached −208.8 mm. Six failures occurred during
plate traversal and four immediately after plate exit. First contacts were
ankle contacts with `plate_0_-1` in six layouts and `plate_0_1` in four. The
first-contact base offsets were approximately 0.21–0.38 m laterally and
−0.20–0.13 m longitudinally from the correct plate center. The corresponding
commanded motion often included simultaneous lateral translation and yaw
correction; realized motion differed substantially around the later fall, while
the unchanged replay itself remained exactly matched.

This rules out a first wall/goal-post collision as the common immediate cause
of these ten falls and points to an unsafe plate entry/traversal state: an ankle
reaches the low plate while the base is offset, then the route continues with
lateral/yaw motion. It does not prove that the first contact alone causes every
later fall. The full per-step trace is retained on the cluster; the tracked
lightweight evidence is
[`diagnostic_summary.json`](../results/mission7-approach-followup-20260922/replay-diagnose-cn-c22/diagnostic_summary.json).

## Candidate mitigation

`PlateSafeRouteController` keeps the measured route controller and official
button semantics, then holds zero translation for 1.0 s after physical plate
contact or gate activation. Its earlier diagnostic replay was 8/10 upright;
the final unlocked route evaluation with the same controller reached 1/16 Doors
success (4 falls, 11 timeouts) and 0/16 Transport success (6 falls,
10 timeouts). The staged replay gate and route evaluation are separate pieces
of evidence: the former establishes a deterministic 10/10 control replay, not
full-route competence.

## Approach controller

The evaluated command interface uses the measured gait response: a nonzero
translation command at or above the calibrated onset range, explicit zero
braking and dwell, heading correction from privileged pose, and one bounded
0.30 m/s forward restart pulse when lateral motion stalls. The evaluation uses
16 layouts per target direction from held-out validation/test geometry, with
matched standstill episodes on identical reset streams.

The completed 64-episode matrix remains below the required 60/64 and
14/16-per-direction gate. Its failure breakdown is concentrated in world −x
goal-post contact; the other directions passed in that run. This is a
controller and clearance issue, not evidence that a sensor policy is ready.

## Gates

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Pressure-plate exact replay, 10/10 upright | **PASS: 10/10** with guarded staged crossing; unchanged baseline 10/10 falls; first staged candidate 9/10; nearest-plate candidate 9/10 |
| Doors ≥16 and Transport ≥16 | **Completed after unlock:** Doors **1/16** (4 falls, 11 timeouts); Transport **0/16** (6 falls, 10 timeouts) |
| Privileged Approach ≥60/64, zero falls, ≥14/16/direction | **FAIL: 56/64**, 0 falls; world −x **8/16**, other directions 16/16 |
| — world −x, 2026-09-23 six-arm probe (96 episodes, geometry/predicates unchanged) | **Geometrically bound:** every command-side arm 7–9/16 or 0/16; succeeding layouts move with crossing phase; robot lateral envelope 0.632 m vs 0.61 m post gap and ≤0.415 m outside margin. Gate unchanged, stays closed. `results/mission7-campaign-20260923/approach-negx-summary.json` |
| — Doors/Transport, 2026-09-23 in-stage factor campaign (10 arms, 160 episodes) | **No improvement:** none exceeds Campaign A's Doors 3/16; the 0.25 m offset + stage activation ties it with falls 5→1 but fails the replay gate 8/10; gate-safe 0.35 m is 1/16. `results/mission7-campaign-20260923/instage-summary.json` |
| — Post-stage stall, `prev_actions_reset` (5 matched exposures) | **Mechanism confirmed, not promoted:** 2 of 5 exposures were genuine stalls and the reset un-stuck both (stall-anchored window; Doors/1 → success); the other 3 were transient pauses; Doors/3 regressed downstream; combined with the in-stage arm it is never exposed (4/4 fail in-stage first). `campaign-b-doors-summary.json` |
| Sensor-only Both readiness | **CLOSED** until both preceding gates pass |
| Four-sensor comparison | **CLOSED** |

## Next steps

1. Keep the sensor-only and four-sensor studies closed. The privileged Approach
   gate remains 56/64, with world −x 8/16, so its release condition is not met.
2. Do not launch another broad route sweep or reopen the closed sensor studies
   from this result. The bounded staged replay gate passed, but the paired route
   evaluation remains low at 1/16 Doors and 0/16 Transport. The early-handoff
   and rejoin probes are complete; the next justified experiment is a
   rejoin-only Doors/layout-1 state-isolation probe using Transport/1 as the
   control, with one route-controller condition varied at a time.
