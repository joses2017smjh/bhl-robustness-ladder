# Slurm job ledger

What we are trying to achieve, which Slurm ID did it, and — when something ran
more than once — one line on why the previous attempt did not count.

**Rolling window: at most three attempts per task, newest first.** When a fourth
attempt happens, drop the oldest row. The point is not a full audit trail; it is
that no task silently disappears and no ID is unattributable.

This file is updated **at submission**, as part of queuing a job, not afterwards
and not on request. A ledger that is only current when someone thinks to ask for
it does not do the job this one exists for.

Status: `todo` · `running` · `done` · `blocked`

Diagnostics that ran once, proved a point and were deleted are in
[one-off probes](#one-off-probes) rather than getting a section each.

## Open

### B4 — limb agents (DirectMARL + skrl) · `todo`
Multiple agents per robot, one per limb, against the single-agent PPO controls.
Gates all 24 Tier-1 rows, so nothing downstream can start until `G-B4` passes.

**Never queued.** No config, no `BHL_ALGO`/`BHL_AGENTS` in `BHL_FORWARD_VARS`,
no `G-B4`, no commits. The `DirectMARL` imports in `scripts/train.py` are Isaac
Lab's stock boilerplate, not this work.

Stack verified present (`21076389`): `direct_marl_env.py` ships in isaaclab
2.3.2, `isaaclab_rl/skrl.py` handles MARL, skrl 1.4.3 has IPPO and MAPPO.
`21076792` installed `rsl-rl-lib==3.0.1` on the v60 venv, which had Isaac Sim
and Isaac Lab and no RL library — the reason RGB training had never run.
Open decisions: how the 22 DoF partition into limbs, and IPPO vs MAPPO.
Constraint from the work order: `joint_deviation_arms` must be ablated in any
22-DoF limb-agent run.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| — | — | not started |

### Tier 1 / 2 / 3 MARL rows · `blocked` on B4
24 + 6 + 8 jobs. Work order: do not queue a tier until its gate passes.
`NUM_ENVS` identical across every arm (target 4096; if MARL OOMs, drop *every*
arm to 2048 and re-run the single-agent controls at 2048 too — do not mix).

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| — | — | not started |

### Compat shim regression check · `done`
The physx shim fired on v51 and broke every v51 task. Guard now tests the
annotation, not `hasattr`.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | `21077722` (v51) | inconclusive — Isaac Sim died during boot on kit DB lock contention with the running terrain arrays. Guard verified from source instead: `physx:` is annotated on 2.3.2, so the shim is skipped there. |
| 1 | `21077723` (v60) | done — 4 shims applied, 36 task ids registered |

### B4 — G-B4 gate · `done`
Design settled (`docs/TASKS_V2.md`): four limb agents, MAPPO, with 2-agent and
IPPO ablations. Code written: `limb_partition.py`, `tasks/limb_marl.py`,
`scripts/train_marl.py`, `scripts/bench/marl_gate.py`.

Offline half (coverage, round-trip, joint order) **passes** on both partitions
and needs no GPU.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | `21090555` | **PASS, both partitions** — limb4 4 agents 5/5/6/6, limb2 2 agents 10/12, obs 75, and the ablation clears `joint_deviation_shoulder` + `joint_deviation_elbow` |
| 4 | `21083178` | TIMEOUT — but limb4 reached `stepped ok`. `simulation_app.close()` sat between the checks and the verdict print and hung for 80 minutes, so a run that had its answer was recorded as a timeout. |
| 3 | `21082868` | FAILED — died silently after "Completed setting up the environment", no traceback. Suspect the `clear_instance()` + `app.close()` teardown, which is redundant now that it is one partition per process. |
| 2 | `21078987` | TIMEOUT — limb4 **passed** (4 agents, 5/5/6/6, obs 75), then hung an hour building limb2 in the same process. Also reported `arm_ablation=TERM NOT FOUND`. |
| 1 | `21078958` | FAIL — pointed at `Biped-Bumpy`, which actuates 12 leg joints, not 22: `Invalid action shape, expected: 12, received: 22`. |

### Tier 1 first block · `done`
`slurm/89_marl_train.sbatch` is written and deliberately not submitted: limb4+
MAPPO, limb4+IPPO, limb2+MAPPO, and a single-agent PPO control, one variable
moving per row. `joint_deviation_arms` is ablated in every row including the
control, and `train_marl.py` refuses to start if the term is not found rather
than assuming the ablation happened.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | `21105252` | **PASS, both partitions, both layouts** — 22 and 24 DoF, and the arm ablation clears both real terms |
| 3 | `21100446` | FAIL — `Invalid action shape, expected: 22, received: 24`: extending the partition for the gripper broke the gate against the 22-DoF task |
| 2 | `21093567` | FAILED — `output with shape [4096, 1] doesn't match the broadcast shape [4096, 4096]`. The env returns a flat `(num_envs,)`; skrl stores one column per agent, so the trailing axis was the whole fix. |
| 4 | `21124513` | COMPLETED — `limb1` control, one agent under the same trainer; readout queued (`21136243`) |
| 3 | `21105320` | **all 3 COMPLETED** — 144k timesteps each. limb2+MAPPO reaches +3.22, limb4+MAPPO +2.08, limb4+IPPO +1.95, all from about -2.6. Reported FAILED by a guard that greps rsl-rl's "Learning iteration" while skrl prints a tqdm bar. |
| 1 | `21091041` | PPO control COMPLETED (5:13); the three MARL rows failed on a missing `num_agents` property, since added |

### Gripper: restore the two hand DoF the asset welds shut · `done`
The hardware has two grippers (`docs/GRIPPER.md`); the shipped asset welds both
hands, so no policy here has ever closed one. `scripts/add_gripper.py` writes a
24-DoF copy into the workspace, leaving `external/` pristine. Checked before
queuing: 24 actuated joints, fingertip sweeps 6.5 cm across the palm, hands
mirrored.

Once the USD lands, this re-runs §5, the nine v2 cells and Tier 1 — the terrain
and locomotion rungs are unaffected, having never used arm contact.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `21093986` | **done** — `assets/gripper/usd/berkeley_humanoid_lite_gripper/berkeley_humanoid_lite_gripper.usda`. The MJCF path landed later (`aed84e1`), so the replay harness renders 24 DoF too: 22 actuators without the flag, 24 with, 48 for a two-robot crew. |

### B3 — ice / patchy friction · `done`
Wired and registered: `Velocity-BHL-Biped-Ice-v0`, `-Ice-Depth-v0`,
`-IceVisible-v0`. G-B3 passes at the flush inset and fails at 5 mm, so the gate
can fail.

The depth arm is the strongest negative control this project has: the patches
are flush, so the ray-caster returns the same flat height field either way. If
depth still helps, the mechanism cannot be that it sees the ice. The visible arm
separates that from "any camera helps once the patch is visible" — colouring the
ice by default would have turned the rung into an RGB experiment.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | `21105232` | **6 of 6 COMPLETED** — depth 1.519, blind 1.374, visible 1.299. Depth beats blind by 10.6% on a hazard it cannot see. |
| 1 | `21100447` | **smoke 3/3**, episode lengths 17.7–19.8 |

### B3 — ice / patchy friction · superseded
`terrains/ice.py` and `scripts/bench/ice_gate.py` written. G-B3 passes at the
flush inset and correctly fails at a 5 mm one, so the gate can fail. Still to
do: wire a task config and register the ids.

| # | id | outcome |

| — | — | not queued |

### Gripper v2 variants · `done`
The three v2 tasks on the 24-DoF asset, as separate ids rather than a flag, so
the welded-hand arms stay runnable as their control. Actions and the
joint-indexed observations move 22 -> 24 together; driving 22 of 24 joints would
leave the grippers inert and the variant indistinguishable from its control.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | `21105399` | **9 of 9 COMPLETED** — grippers survive **~450 steps against 8**, reward **+14.3 against −0.79**. Task success still 0 in every cell. |
| 1 | `21105363` | smoke 3/3, episode lengths 7.3–7.4 |

### Cloth sorting — G-C1 throughput · `done` — the answer is scripted, not RL
Decides RL against scripted demo. Still undecided: three probes, none of which
measured cloth. The next one has to build the deformable properly --
`DeformableObjectCfg` with a Newton VBD solver, as
`isaaclab_tasks/.../lift_franka_soft` does -- rather than spawning a mesh and
assuming the solver picks it up.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 12 | `21185969` | **G-C1 answered, twelve attempts in.** Newton VBD cloth, 961-vertex mesh, `robot@5.0` resolved and nothing dropped: **182 env-steps/s at 8 envs, 177 at 32, 71 at 128**, and 512 envs overflows a signed 32-bit array dimension (7.3e9). Throughput *falls* with parallelism, so there is no scale to buy. A standard 8,000-iteration arm here is 786M env-steps: about **50 days** at cloth's peak rate against **6 minutes** at the rigid-body rate. RL on this is not a scheduling problem, it is a different project. **The sorting task gets scripted demos.** |
| 11 | `21185935` | FAILED — the Franka resolved and the scene built for the first time, then `KeyError: 'ee_frame'` at the first step: `deformable_ee_distance` reads that sensor every step and attempt 9 had removed it. Removing it was a fix for a bug that no longer existed. |
| 10 | `21185828` | FAILED, and it proved the point — `FileNotFoundError` on `.../Isaac/6.0/.../panda_instanceable.usd`. Not flakiness: Isaac Lab 3.0.0b2 asks the 6.0 asset tree for a file that was never published there. The identical file is served under 5.0 and 4.5. Nine attempts had read that 404 as "this asset is optional" and deleted the robot. |
| 9 | `21153326` | FAILED — the site-injection fix worked and the localiser then ate the robot: `The scene entity 'robot' does not exist. Available entities: ['terrain', 'deformable', 'table', 'ground', 'sky_light', 'cube']`. One slow HEAD against the content server is enough to condemn an asset permanently for the run, and the Franka drew the short straw this time. The same URL loaded fine in attempt 8, so this is flakiness being treated as evidence. |
| 8 | `21146031` | FAILED — but it got further than any before it. The assets resolved, the Franka loaded, the VBD cloth registered at 961 vertices; it died in `NewtonManager._cl_inject_sites` with `Site 'ft_4' ... matched no prototype bodies`. Newton's prototype builder labels bodies differently from the USD stage, so `ee_frame`, anchored on `panda_link0`, cannot be injected as a site when the scene clones. That is Isaac Lab 3.0.0b2's cloner, not this repo. |
| 7 | `21136400` | FAILED — dropping every remote asset removed the Franka, and the scene's force-torque sites reference it: `Site 'ft_2' ... matched no prototype bodies` |
| 6 | `21136231` | cancelled before it ran — a visual-only substitute still guesses at the prim's role |
| 5 | `21125073` | FAILED — my replacement carried `rigid_props`, so `FrameView` refused it: "prim '/World/envs/env_0/Table' is a Newton physics body" |

### Demo clips for the README · `running`
The MuJoCo replay harness cannot render the gripper arms — it builds its crew
from the 22-DoF MJCF and the gripper asset is a 24-DoF URDF. So the clips come
from Isaac Sim 6.0, which is the stack those policies trained on and where RTX
works.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | `21185827` | running — ask for `alg.policy` or `alg.actor`, whichever the installed rsl-rl has, and treat the ONNX/JIT export as non-fatal. The export is a deployment artefact; a replay job should not die for it. |
| 4 | `21153325` | FAILED — and the config migration worked. It loaded the checkpoint and died one line later on `AttributeError: 'PPO' object has no attribute 'policy'`: rsl-rl 3.0.1 calls the actor `alg.policy`, 5.0.1 calls it `alg.actor`, and this file was written against 3.0.1. Still before any frame is drawn. |
| 3 | `21146513` | FAILED, reported COMPLETED — `TypeError: MLPModel.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'stochastic'`. The path fix worked and exposed the real bug: `RslRlMLPModelCfg.to_dict()` still emits `stochastic`, `init_noise_std`, `state_dependent_std` and `noise_std_type`, and rsl-rl 5.0.1 splats the dict into a model that takes none of them. `train.py` migrates the cfg first; `train_play.py` never did, so **every v60 checkpoint trained fine and none could be replayed**. The mp4 count caught it. |

### Plank cells, re-run on the fixed scene · `done` — ejection fixed, task still dead
The six original plank cells measured a scene that ejected its own payload, and
their gripper arms showed none of the survival effect the cube and ball arms did
— episode length 11.6 against 428. Re-run at the 1.05 m stand-off.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `21146058` | **6 of 6 COMPLETED** (10:07–22:23). Read from the event files: the stand-off fixed the ejection — episode length is 354–491 against 11.6 before — and the task itself is still dead. `lift_height` sits on its 0.04 m curriculum floor in all six arms at the full 8,000 iterations, peak == tail == 0.0400, so it never promoted once across 48,000 arm-iterations. `success` is 0.0000 everywhere, and `leaned` and `lifting_object` never fire. Reward ~13 is `still_alive` and posture: the robots learned to stand next to the plank for the whole episode. The rgb arm falls in 42.6% of episodes against 1.9–7.7% for the other five. |

### Manipulation re-runs on the fixed spawn · `running` — queued 2026-09-05
All 18 arms, re-trained with `plant_feet` in place. `RUN_PREFIX` keeps them out
of the run labels of the buried arms they supersede, so the before/after is
readable instead of concatenated.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `21186402` | running — 9 v2 cells, `RUN_PREFIX=v2fix` |
| 1 | `21186403` | running — 9 gripper cells, `RUN_PREFIX=gripfix` |

**Queued with one bug fixed and one open.** The burial is fixed and verified;
the 39 cm hand asymmetry is not. Started anyway because the burial was the
dominant fault — 19 of 27 bodies underground and an extrusion lasting about ten
steps, against a mean episode length of eight — and because blocking 18 runs on
a fifth probe of a bug that has already survived four costs more than re-running
if the asymmetry later turns out to matter. If it is fixed, these need redoing.

### v2 / coop spawn puts the robot through the floor · `open` — found 2026-09-05
Noticed from the Isaac clip: the robots lie flat and clip the ground instead of
resetting upright dozens of times, which is what ~8-step episodes should look
like in a 300-step video.

**Confirmed, measured against a working task rather than asserted:**

| at reset | v2 CubeToShelf | 22-DoF locomotion (control) |
|---|---|---|
| root z | **-0.0700** | +0.0000 |
| lowest body | `arm_left_elbow_roll` @ **-0.2648** | `base` @ -0.0000 |
| bodies below z=0 | **19 of 27** | **1 of 27** |
| after 10 zero-action steps | 0 of 27 — extruded | 1 of 27 — stable |

The control's single body is `base`, whose origin is the asset's reference point;
it stays at 1 and the root drifts to -0.046 as the robot settles on its feet. The
v2 robot is *extruded* by depenetration over about ten steps — the same failure
class as the plank ejection, which was fixed for the plank only.

`fallen` reads 0.0000 the whole way through, so nothing terminates on it.

**What this puts in doubt.** Every coop_lift and v2 result: the cube, ball and
plank arms, all nine v2 cells and all nine gripper cells — which is the whole
"task success 0" column. Welded-hand arms die at ~8 steps, and extrusion takes
about 10, so those episodes ended inside the window where the robot was still
being pushed out of the floor. It also weakens finding 10: some of the gripper's
6.3 -> 427.7 step gain may be surviving a broken spawn rather than having hands.

The locomotion half is untouched — it spawns at z = 0 and is the control here.

Also at reset: both ankles are under the floor, and the hands sit at **-0.261
and +0.138** — a 40 cm split in a pose that reads as symmetric in the source —
while the payload waits at +0.300. The reach band says a standing robot's hands
span 0.404-0.610 with the feet planted, so the spawn does not implement the
geometry the tasks were designed around.

**Cause found: it is Isaac-only, and it is two bugs.**

Cross-checked in MuJoCo with the *same* `PINCH_POSE`, on CPU:

| at reset | Isaac | MuJoCo |
|---|---|---|
| left hand z | -0.261 | **+0.5804** |
| right hand z | +0.138 | **+0.5804** |
| hand split | **0.399 m** | **0.0000 m** |
| ankles | -0.106 / -0.053 | +0.1917 / +0.1917 |
| bodies below z=0 | 19 of 27 | 2 of 50 (`base` frames) |

1. **No feet planting.** `CrewRunner.reset` measures the lowest collision geom
   and translates the base onto the plane, precisely because it "does not trust
   that the two descriptions of the robot put their root frames in the same
   place". Isaac uses the hardcoded `_PINCH_ROOT_Z = -0.07` and does not.
2. **The pinch pose is asymmetric in Isaac and not in MuJoCo — still open.** Same joint values,
   symmetric in MuJoCo, 40 cm apart in Isaac. `21186283` swept every
   sign combination the joint limits allow: the best achievable split is
   **0.3519 m**, so no pose config can fix it. At the *default* arm pose Isaac
   is symmetric (+0.485 / +0.484 on the locomotion control), so the limits were
   mirrored by the conversion and the axes were not.

MuJoCo hands land at +0.58, inside the 0.404-0.610 band `reach_band.py` measured
the tasks against. Isaac never put the robot in the pose the tasks assume.

**Bug 1 is fixed.** `plant_feet` (`coop_lift_mdp.py`) measures the lowest body at
reset and translates the root onto the plane, the way `CrewRunner.reset` has
always done in MuJoCo. Verified `21186378`: **0 of 27 bodies below z = 0** at
reset and after stepping, root settling at +0.18 rather than the assumed -0.07.

**Bug 2 is open, and four hypotheses are dead.** Joint-sign mirroring read off
the URDF origins (rejected: the limits forbid it, `21186243`); the spawn
quaternion tipping the robot (rejected: `up_z = 1.000` at every rotation,
`21186364`); a single mis-axed joint (rejected: the same ~0.5 m split appears
whatever pair is driven and whatever the signs, `21186353`); the shipped USD
being asymmetric (rejected: at zero arm angles it is symmetric to 4 dp,
`21186390`). So the asset is fine and the same joint values mean different
things to the two descriptions — where, is not yet established.

**What this re-scopes.** Every MuJoCo-scored number used a correct spawn, so the
sim2sim results stand: 7.8 cm best cube lift, plank 0.0 cm, pinch-gate 98%, the
fall rates. What was broken is *training* -- every Isaac-side metric was measured
on robots that start buried with one arm through the floor. That is finding 10's
6.3 -> 427.7 steps, the reward figures, and the task-success-0 column.

**Earlier hypothesis, rejected and worth keeping.** First hypothesis was the mirroring
convention: every joint declares `axis="0 0 1"`, so symmetry depends on each
joint's origin rotation, and by that reading the elbows, knees and ankles were
all set the wrong way round. **Isaac disproved it on the next run** — the joint
limits are the authority and they say the original signs were right:

    'arm_right_elbow_pitch_joint': 0.900 not in [-1.571, -0.000]
    'leg_right_knee_pitch_joint': -1.450 not in [-0.000, 2.443]

So the corrected pose was invalid and is reverted. The next step is to sweep
sign combinations that are *within* the limits and measure hand symmetry and
foot clearance, rather than to reason from the URDF again.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | (CPU, no job) | MuJoCo cross-check: same pose, hands symmetric to 4 dp, feet planted. The bug does not exist there. |
| 4 | `21186283` | **sign sweep: no combination works.** Every valid variant leaves a 0.35-0.40 m hand split against MuJoCo's 0.0000, which moves the cause from the config to the asset. |
| 3 | `21186243` | hypothesis rejected — the "corrected" mirroring puts two joints outside their limits. Reverted. |
| 2 | `21186214` | **confirmed with a control** — table above |
| 1 | `21186202` | first measurement, suspect task only: 19 of 27 bodies below z=0. No control, so it could not yet distinguish a bug from this asset's frame convention. |

### Plank spawn ejection · `done`
`plank_leaned` no longer fires on a zero action (0.000 at every step, was 0.031
at step 20) — the stationary requirement fixed the predicate. **Cause found, geometrically rather than by guess:** at x = ±0.85 the hands
begin **18.7 cm inside** a plank spanning ±0.75 — hand reach is 0.25 m and the
hand link is 74 mm across, so the near edge sits at 0.563 against a plank end at
0.750. The contact solver resolves that overlap by ejecting the payload. Support
clearance was never the issue.

Stand-off is now 1.05 m, which clears the plank by 13 mm and still reaches the
contact point with 50 mm to spare. The wall moved from x = 1.0 to 2.4, because
at the new stand-off a wall at 1.0 would have been behind one of the robots.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `21136378` | running — recheck at the 1.05 m stand-off |
| 2 | `21125100` | predicate fixed, ejection remains — plank still reaches 0.52 m unaided |
| 1 | `21124909` | found it — 0.031 success with a zero action, plank launching 22 cm |

### Base-height probe — is the floor-lift a training hack? · `done` — yes
The MuJoCo replay drops both cube arms ~41 cm in 0.2 s, before contact. PhysX
`base_contact` sits at -0.003, so the torso is not down in training — but a
robot folded onto its shins never puts its torso down either, so that cannot
separate a squat from a collapse. `base_height` is now a weight-0.0 reward term
so the curve is recorded without entering the objective.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 6 | `21090556` | **done, and it settles the question** — 6,000 iterations on `coop_lift`. Base height rises to −0.107 by iteration ~350, then descends monotonically to −0.236 and plateaus near −0.229. The torso ends about 23 cm below nominal and stays there, so the policy is lowering its body, not raising the cube. Attempt 4 saw the first 1,500 iterations of this and could only say it was "still falling"; it lands. This is the training-side counterpart of the 41 cm drop the MuJoCo replay shows before contact. |
| 5 | `21082873` | TIMEOUT at 4 h — 6,000 iterations at 1024 envs does not fit; not a code fault |
| 4 | `21078881` | **done** — base height climbs to -0.105 by iteration ~350 then descends monotonically to -0.167 by 1,500, and is still falling |
| 3 | `21077648` | FAILED — the physx shim fired on v51 and broke the import |
| 2 | `21076968` | FAILED — `base_height expects optional parameters ['robot_a','robot_b'] but received []` |
| 1 | `21076488` | cancelled — logged 0.0000 for 1,300 iterations. The reward manager logs `weight x value`, so a weight-0.0 term reports zero by construction. |

### Redesigned tasks (v2) — nine cells · `done` — all nine trained, none succeeded
`slurm/90_v2_train_smoke.sbatch` added: 3 iterations at 64 envs through the real
training path, one arm per vision condition. The env smoke passed 9/9 during
every one of the training failures because it never executes `train.py` — a gate
that does not run the thing it gates is decoration.

Three tasks with terminal success states, each blind/depth/rgb, all on v60.
Gates G-T1/G-T2/G-T3 pass, the nine-cell smoke passes, training is queued at
seed 0. `NUM_ENVS=1024` for every cell and it must stay identical across them —
if RGB OOMs, drop all nine to 512 rather than mixing.

**Training**

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 13 | `21105231` | **9 of 9 COMPLETED** — welded hands survive ~8 steps, reward −0.79, success 0 |
| 12 | `21105217` | **smoke 4/4**, episode length 13.5–18.0. `either_fallen` now derives tilt from the root quaternion. |
| 11 | `21100627` | FAILED — guard caught it: `mean episode length is 1.00`. Wrapping ProxyArray reads was not the cause. |
| 10 | `21093953` | **CANCELLED — the runs were degenerate.** 8,000 iterations each at `mean_episode_length = 1.00` and `Episode_Termination/fallen = 1.00`: `either_fallen` read `projected_gravity_b` as a tensor when 3.x returns a warp ProxyArray, so `[:, 2]` was not the z component and every episode ended on step one. Nine GPU-days. |
| 9 | `21093566` | **training smoke 4/4** — 3 logged iterations each, incl. the solo ball control. Fix was pickling: `_variants()` built classes with `type()` so they were not module attributes and Hydra could not pickle them. |
| 8 | `21091042` | FAILED — `_pickle.PicklingError` on the generated variant classes |
| 7 | `21090547` | FAILED — **segfault** in Isaac Sim ~3 s in, before the env is built, on two different nodes (cn-gpu5, cn-gpu7) while the env smoke passed on cn-gpu6. Not a Python fault and not one bad node. |
| 6 | `21083804` | FAILED — same `stochastic` error. `RslRlMLPModelCfg` still carries deprecated `stochastic`/`init_noise_std` fields; isaaclab_rl ships `handle_deprecated_rsl_rl_cfg` to strip them and our vendored `train.py` never called it. |
| 5 | `21083755` | FAILED — `MLPModel.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'stochastic'`. The actor needs `distribution_cfg`; without it the runner asks for a stochastic model the config never declared. Caught by the new **training-path** smoke, in 33 seconds. |
| 4 | `21083690` | done — env smoke 9/9, obs 194/322/578. Note: this builds envs and never runs `train.py`, so it passed through all three training failures. |
| 3 | `21083185` | FAILED, all 9 — `KeyError: 'class_name'`. rsl-rl 5.x reads `cfg["actor"]["class_name"]`; the v51 runner config sets only the 2.x `policy` field. |
| 2 | `21082869` | FAILED, all 9 — `PPO.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'optimizer'`. I had installed rsl-rl 3.0.1 on v60 to match v51; isaaclab_rl 3.0.0b2 pins **5.0.1**. |
| 1 | `21077757` | FAILED, all 9 in ~20 s — `scripts/train.py` imported `berkeley_humanoid_lite.tasks` *before* applying the compat shim, so `AdditiveUniformNoiseCfg` was still missing on v60. The smoke test never caught it because it imports only `bhl_robust.tasks`. |

**Kinematic gates**

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `21076923` | **3/3 PASS** — G-T1 15.5 cm squat, G-T2 all targets reachable, G-T3 collapse excluded |
| 2 | `21076834` | passed G-T1/G-T3; G-T2 did not exist yet |
| 1 | `21076816` | FAIL — the gate bent the knees with the root pinned, which lifts the feet instead of squatting, and compared the base body origin against an absolute height in a frame whose origin sits 0.137 m below the feet |

**Nine-cell smoke**

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `21077235` | **9/9** — obs 194 blind / 322 depth / 578 rgb |
| 2 | `21077210` | 9/9 "ok" but obs 194 on every one: cameras mounted, no observation term read them, so the sighted arms were copies of the blind one |
| 1 | `21077181` | `NameError: _root` — an unbounded string replace hit five call sites in four other functions |

Earlier smoke attempts, each cleared one Isaac Lab 3.x breakage and exposed the
next: `21076944` `SimulationCfg.physx`, `21077015`/`21077044` warp `ProxyArray`
vs `torch.jit`, `21077084` ProxyArray `.shape` sizing observation terms as `()`,
`21077115` `.dtype` as a ctypes type, `21077139`/`21077158` curriculum `env_ids`
signature.

### Terrain PPO, seed 2 · `done` — all 4 arms COMPLETED, result holds at n=3
Third seed of all four cells, because n=2 is below this project's own bar.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | `21076264` | **done** (`_0` still finishing) — third seed does not overturn the result: depth 2.5x on friction, 1.10x on stairs, no blind/depth overlap in either cell |
| 1 | `21076260` | cancelled — `--array=8-11` re-ran seeds 0 and 1, because the array maths is `S = IDX % 2`. Added `SEED_OFFSET`. |

### Occlusion replicates · `done` — it does not replicate
Does the one cube arm that ever lifted reproduce? So far: no.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `21066826_6` | **done** — blind seed 2, flat: tail 0.0400, peak 0.0408 over 16,000 iterations, episode length 195. **1 of 4 blind seeds ever lifted**, and that one is the odd one out in a second way — its episodes run 51 steps against ~195 for the three flat seeds, so it lifts in runs that end early rather than in runs that go the distance. |
| 2 | `21066825_6` | **done** — blind seed 1, flat at 0.0400 for all 16,000 iters. Does not replicate seed 0. |
| 1 | `21066823_7` | done — depth-under-occlusion, first genuine run; flat |

Superseded: `21066824` cancelled — `SEED` was hardcoded in the sbatch so
`--export=ALL,SEED=1` was overwritten, and the run name would have collided
with seed 0's.

## Closed

### B2 — stairs entry gate · `done`
| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `21066021` | **PASS** — 5 cm restored, 2,000 iters, verdict from the event file: level 0.1073 vs control 0.1345 |
| 2 | `21065762` | FAIL (wrong) — re-probed at 3 cm after attempt 1's verdict; `tail -40` left one `terrain_levels` line in the log for `tail -1` to read as final |
| 1 | `21036975` | FAIL (wrong) — 5 cm, 300 iterations, no control; the pinned curriculum was the training budget, not the riser |

### Terrain PPO, seeds 0–1 · `done`
8 arms: slippery × stairs × blind/depth × 2 seeds.
| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `21066022` | done — 8/8 completed, 6,000 iters each |
| 2 | `21065763` | cancelled — sat in `DependencyNeverSatisfied`, chained to the 3 cm probe that failed |
| 1 | `21036976` | cancelled — sat in `DependencyNeverSatisfied`, chained to the original probe that failed |

### POV clips · `done`
Eight clips with the robot's own colour + depth strip.
| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `21067084` | done — all 8 in one pass on one log depth ramp |
| 2 | `21066637` | cancelled — the depth ramp was edited mid-job, so clips either side of the edit would disagree on what a brightness means |
| 1 | `21066607` | FAILED — `clip()` shell function: after `shift 5` the gif width fell into `"$@"` and reached `render_carry.py` as a stray positional |

### Ladder clip · `done`
| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `21067057` | done — re-rendered after the slot-order fix; the `+x` robot was appended first but `members[0]` is read as the negative-axis slot, so the pair had each other's contact points |

### Docs + charts refresh · `done`
| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | `21066817` | done — curves re-extracted with the newest-run-wins fix, charts redrawn |
| 1 | `21066624` | FAILED — `chart_nine` called `c.pw()` on a property |

## One-off probes

Ran once, answered one question, kept only as a reference for where a number
came from.

| id | question it answered |
|---|---|
| `21076389` | Does this stack have DirectMARL + skrl? Yes — but a bare import fails, `AppLauncher` has to run first |
| `21076249` | Terrain levels for all 8 arms, from event files rather than log tails |
| `21076223` | Occlusion replicate seeds and depth variant: all flat |
| `21067145` | Pelvis height vs feet — `tilt()` cannot see a level collapse |
| `21067131` | Base descent over a rollout; the ladder pair sinks ~34 cm |
| `21067071` | Depth distribution per payload: cube 0.10 m, ball 0.16 m, ladder 0.85 m medians |
| `21066787` | Occlusion runs pre/post `apply_depth_flags` fix, read per directory |
| `21066007` | G-B2 verdict with a control column — returned INCONCLUSIVE, which is what forced the 2,000-iteration re-probe |
| `21066041` | First depth-distribution measurement (cube and ball only) |

## Keeping this current

Add a row the moment a job is submitted, not when it finishes — the row whose
absence caused this file is the one nobody wrote down. When a task's table hits
four rows, delete the oldest.

Verify an id before trusting a row:

```bash
export PATH=/apps/slurm/current/bin:$PATH
sacct -j <id> --format=JobID%14,JobName%14,State%12,Elapsed -X
```

A "why it was re-run" line should name the cause, not the symptom. "Failed" is
not a reason; "the gif width fell into `"$@"` after `shift 5`" is.
