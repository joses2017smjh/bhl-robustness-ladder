# Slurm job ledger

What we are trying to achieve, which Slurm ID did it, and — when something ran
more than once — one line on why the previous attempt did not count.

**Rolling window: at most three attempts per task, newest first.** When a fourth
attempt happens, drop the oldest row. The point is not a full audit trail; it is
that no task silently disappears and no ID is unattributable.

This file is updated **at submission**, as part of queuing a job, not afterwards
and not on request. A ledger that is only current when someone thinks to ask for
it does not do the job this one exists for.

Status: `todo` · `running` · `done` · `blocked`

Diagnostics that ran once, proved a point and were deleted are in
[one-off probes](#one-off-probes) rather than getting a section each.

## Open

### B4 — limb agents (DirectMARL + skrl) · `todo`
Multiple agents per robot, one per limb, against the single-agent PPO controls.
Gates all 24 Tier-1 rows, so nothing downstream can start until `G-B4` passes.

**Never queued.** No config, no `BHL_ALGO`/`BHL_AGENTS` in `BHL_FORWARD_VARS`,
no `G-B4`, no commits. The `DirectMARL` imports in `scripts/train.py` are Isaac
Lab's stock boilerplate, not this work.

Stack verified present (`21076389`): `direct_marl_env.py` ships in isaaclab
2.3.2, `isaaclab_rl/skrl.py` handles MARL, skrl 1.4.3 has IPPO and MAPPO.
`21076792` installed `rsl-rl-lib==3.0.1` on the v60 venv, which had Isaac Sim
and Isaac Lab and no RL library — the reason RGB training had never run.
Open decisions: how the 22 DoF partition into limbs, and IPPO vs MAPPO.
Constraint from the work order: `joint_deviation_arms` must be ablated in any
22-DoF limb-agent run.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| — | — | not started |

### B3 — ice / patchy friction terrain · `todo`
Patchy friction on geometrically flat ground. `G-B3` has to ray-cast the patch
boundary to prove the patch is invisible to the depth camera.

**Never queued.** `src/bhl_robust/terrains/` holds only `bumpy.py` and
`stairs.py`.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| — | — | not started |

### Tier 1 / 2 / 3 MARL rows · `blocked` on B4
24 + 6 + 8 jobs. Work order: do not queue a tier until its gate passes.
`NUM_ENVS` identical across every arm (target 4096; if MARL OOMs, drop *every*
arm to 2048 and re-run the single-agent controls at 2048 too — do not mix).

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| — | — | not started |

### Base-height probe — is the floor-lift a training hack? · `running`
The MuJoCo replay drops both cube arms ~41 cm in 0.2 s, before contact. PhysX
`base_contact` sits at -0.003, so the torso is not down in training — but a
robot folded onto its shins never puts its torso down either, so that cannot
separate a squat from a collapse. `base_height` is now a weight-0.0 reward term
so the curve is recorded without entering the objective.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `21077648` | running — `SceneEntityCfg` params dropped; the manager resolves those by introspection and then demands the config declare them |
| 2 | `21076968` | FAILED — `base_height expects optional parameters ['robot_a','robot_b'] but received []` |
| 1 | `21076488` | cancelled — logged 0.0000 for 1,300 iterations. The reward manager logs `weight x value`, so a weight-0.0 term reports zero by construction. |

### Redesigned tasks (v2) — nine cells · `todo` (built, not trained)
Three tasks with terminal success states, each blind/depth/rgb, all on v60.
Gates G-T1/G-T2/G-T3 pass and the nine-cell smoke passes. **No training queued
yet** — that is the next step.

**Kinematic gates**

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `21076923` | **3/3 PASS** — G-T1 15.5 cm squat, G-T2 all targets reachable, G-T3 collapse excluded |
| 2 | `21076834` | passed G-T1/G-T3; G-T2 did not exist yet |
| 1 | `21076816` | FAIL — the gate bent the knees with the root pinned, which lifts the feet instead of squatting, and compared the base body origin against an absolute height in a frame whose origin sits 0.137 m below the feet |

**Nine-cell smoke**

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `21077235` | **9/9** — obs 194 blind / 322 depth / 578 rgb |
| 2 | `21077210` | 9/9 "ok" but obs 194 on every one: cameras mounted, no observation term read them, so the sighted arms were copies of the blind one |
| 1 | `21077181` | `NameError: _root` — an unbounded string replace hit five call sites in four other functions |

Earlier smoke attempts, each cleared one Isaac Lab 3.x breakage and exposed the
next: `21076944` `SimulationCfg.physx`, `21077015`/`21077044` warp `ProxyArray`
vs `torch.jit`, `21077084` ProxyArray `.shape` sizing observation terms as `()`,
`21077115` `.dtype` as a ctypes type, `21077139`/`21077158` curriculum `env_ids`
signature.

### Terrain PPO, seed 2 · `running`
Third seed of all four cells, because n=2 is below this project's own bar.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | `21076264` | running — `_0 _2 _4` up, `_6` pending on `MaxGRESRunMinsPerUser` |
| 1 | `21076260` | cancelled — `--array=8-11` re-ran seeds 0 and 1, because the array maths is `S = IDX % 2`. Added `SEED_OFFSET`. |

### Occlusion replicates · `running`
Does the one cube arm that ever lifted reproduce? So far: no.

| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `21066826_6` | running — blind seed 2, flat at 0.0400 |
| 2 | `21066825_6` | **done** — blind seed 1, flat at 0.0400 for all 16,000 iters. Does not replicate seed 0. |
| 1 | `21066823_7` | done — depth-under-occlusion, first genuine run; flat |

Superseded: `21066824` cancelled — `SEED` was hardcoded in the sbatch so
`--export=ALL,SEED=1` was overwritten, and the run name would have collided
with seed 0's.

## Closed

### B2 — stairs entry gate · `done`
| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `21066021` | **PASS** — 5 cm restored, 2,000 iters, verdict from the event file: level 0.1073 vs control 0.1345 |
| 2 | `21065762` | FAIL (wrong) — re-probed at 3 cm after attempt 1's verdict; `tail -40` left one `terrain_levels` line in the log for `tail -1` to read as final |
| 1 | `21036975` | FAIL (wrong) — 5 cm, 300 iterations, no control; the pinned curriculum was the training budget, not the riser |

### Terrain PPO, seeds 0–1 · `done`
8 arms: slippery × stairs × blind/depth × 2 seeds.
| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `21066022` | done — 8/8 completed, 6,000 iters each |
| 2 | `21065763` | cancelled — sat in `DependencyNeverSatisfied`, chained to the 3 cm probe that failed |
| 1 | `21036976` | cancelled — sat in `DependencyNeverSatisfied`, chained to the original probe that failed |

### POV clips · `done`
Eight clips with the robot's own colour + depth strip.
| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `21067084` | done — all 8 in one pass on one log depth ramp |
| 2 | `21066637` | cancelled — the depth ramp was edited mid-job, so clips either side of the edit would disagree on what a brightness means |
| 1 | `21066607` | FAILED — `clip()` shell function: after `shift 5` the gif width fell into `"$@"` and reached `render_carry.py` as a stray positional |

### Ladder clip · `done`
| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `21067057` | done — re-rendered after the slot-order fix; the `+x` robot was appended first but `members[0]` is read as the negative-axis slot, so the pair had each other's contact points |

### Docs + charts refresh · `done`
| # | id | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | `21066817` | done — curves re-extracted with the newest-run-wins fix, charts redrawn |
| 1 | `21066624` | FAILED — `chart_nine` called `c.pw()` on a property |

## One-off probes

Ran once, answered one question, kept only as a reference for where a number
came from.

| id | question it answered |
|---|---|
| `21076389` | Does this stack have DirectMARL + skrl? Yes — but a bare import fails, `AppLauncher` has to run first |
| `21076249` | Terrain levels for all 8 arms, from event files rather than log tails |
| `21076223` | Occlusion replicate seeds and depth variant: all flat |
| `21067145` | Pelvis height vs feet — `tilt()` cannot see a level collapse |
| `21067131` | Base descent over a rollout; the ladder pair sinks ~34 cm |
| `21067071` | Depth distribution per payload: cube 0.10 m, ball 0.16 m, ladder 0.85 m medians |
| `21066787` | Occlusion runs pre/post `apply_depth_flags` fix, read per directory |
| `21066007` | G-B2 verdict with a control column — returned INCONCLUSIVE, which is what forced the 2,000-iteration re-probe |
| `21066041` | First depth-distribution measurement (cube and ball only) |

## Keeping this current

Add a row the moment a job is submitted, not when it finishes — the row whose
absence caused this file is the one nobody wrote down. When a task's table hits
four rows, delete the oldest.

Verify an id before trusting a row:

```bash
export PATH=/apps/slurm/current/bin:$PATH
sacct -j <id> --format=JobID%14,JobName%14,State%12,Elapsed -X
```

A "why it was re-run" line should name the cause, not the symptom. "Failed" is
not a reason; "the gif width fell into `"$@"` after `shift 5`" is.
